Utility</a></h1>

<h2>The Basics</h2>

<p>Originally developed to generate the Mini-XML and CUPS API
documentation, the <tt>mxmldoc(1)</tt> program converts C and C++
source files into an intermediate XML format and uses in-line
comments rather than comment headers to annotate functions, types,
and constants.</p>

<h2>Commenting Your Code</h2>

<h2>Creating HTML Documentation</h2>

<h2>Creating Man Pages</h2>

<h2>The XML Schema</h2>

<p><i>mxmldoc</i> scans the specified C and C++ source files to
produce an XML representation of globally accessible classes,
constants, enumerations, functions, structures, typedefs,
unions, and variables. The XML file is updated as necessary and
a HTML representation of the XML file is written to the standard
output. If no source files are specified then the current XML
file is converted to HTML on the standard output.
<p>In general, any C or C++ source code is handled by
<i>mxmldoc</i>, however it was specifically written to handle
code with documentation that is formatted according to the CUPS
Configuration Management Plan which is available at
"http://www.cups.org/documentation.php".
