%description <<EOF
Mini-XML is a small XML parsing library that you can use to read
XML and XML-like data files in your application without
requiring large non-standard libraries.  Mini-XML provides the
following functionality:

    - Reading and writing of UTF-8 encoded XML files.
    - Data is stored in a linked-list tree structure, preserving
      the XML data hierarchy.
    - Supports arbitrary element names, attributes, and
      attribute values with no preset limits, just available
      memory.
    - Supports integer, real, opaque ("cdata"), and text data
      types in "leaf" nodes.
    - Functions for creating and managing trees of data.
    - "Find" and "walk" functions for easily locating and
      navigating trees of data.

Mini-XML doesn't do validation or other types of processing on
the data based upon schema files or other sources of definition
information, nor does it support character entities other than
those required by the XML specification.  Also, since Mini-XML
does not support the UTF-16 encoding, it is technically not a
conforming XML consumer/client.
