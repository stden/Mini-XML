<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>Mini-XML is a small XML parsing library that you can use to
read XML and XML-like data files in your application without
requiring large non-standard libraries. Mini-XML only requires
an ANSI C compatible compiler (GCC works, as do most vendors'
ANSI C compilers) and a "make" program.

<P>Mini-XML was created to support the basic hierarchy provided
by XML and some simple data types, but doesn't do validation or
other types of processing on the data.

<H2>Building Mini-XML</H2>

<P>Mini-XML comes with an autoconf-based configure script; just
type the following command to get things going:

<PRE>
    ./configure
</PRE>

<P>The default install prefix is /usr/local, which can be
overridden using the --prefix option:

<PRE>
    ./configure --prefix=/foo
</PRE>

<P>Once you have configured the software, type "make" to do the
build and then run the test program to verify that things are
working, as follows:

<PRE>
    make
    ./testmxml test.xml
</PRE>

<H2>Installing Mini-XML</H2>

<P>The "install" target will install Mini-XML in the lib and
include directories:

<PRE>
    make install
</PRE>

<P>Once you have installed it, use the "-lmxml" option to link
your application against it.

<H2>Documentation</H2>

<P>The documentation is currently just in this page.  At
some point I'll probably do some proper documentation, but
for now just read here and look at the testmxml.c source
file for an example of reading and printing the contents of
an XML file to stdout.

<P>Mini-XML provides a single header file which you include:

<PRE>
    #include &lt;mxml.h>
</PRE>

<P>Nodes are defined by the "mxml_node_t" structure; the "type"
member defines the node type (element, integer, opaque,
real, or text) which determines which value you want to look
at in the "value" union.  New nodes can be created using the
"mxmlNewElement()", "mxmlNewInteger()", "mxmlNewOpaque()",
"mxmlNewReal()", and "mxmlNewText()" functions.  Only
elements can have child nodes, and the top node must be an
element, usually "?xml".

<P>You load an XML file using the "mxmlLoadFile()" function:

<PRE>
    FILE *fp;
    mxml_node_t *tree;

    fp = fopen("filename.xml", "r");
    tree = mxmlLoadFile(NULL, fp, MXML_NO_CALLBACK);
    fclose(fp);
</PRE>

<P>Similarly, you save an XML file using the "mxmlSaveFile()"
function:

<PRE>
    FILE *fp;
    mxml_node_t *tree;

    fp = fopen("filename.xml", "w");
    mxmlSaveFile(tree, fp);
    fclose(fp);
</PRE>

<P>You can find a named element/node using the
"mxmlFindElement()" function:

<PRE>
    mxml_node_t *node = mxmlFindElement(tree, tree, "name");
</PRE>

<P>You can also iterate with the same function:

<PRE>
    mxml_node_t *node;

    for (node = mxmlFindElement(tree, tree, "name");
	 node != NULL;
	 node = mxmlFindElement(node, tree, "name"))
    {
      ... do something ...
    }
</PRE>

<P>Finally, once you are done with the XML data, use the
"mxmlDelete()" function to free the memory that is used:

<PRE>
    mxmlDelete(tree);
</PRE>

<H2>Getting Help and Reporting Problems</H2>

<P>You can email me at "mxml <I>at</I> easysw <I>dot</I> com" to
report problems and/or ask for help.  Just don't expect an
instant response, as I get a *lot* of email...
