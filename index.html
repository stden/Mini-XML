<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Mini-XML is a small XML parsing library that you can use to
read XML and XML-like data files in your application without
requiring large non-standard libraries. Mini-XML only requires
an ANSI C compatible compiler (GCC works, as do most vendors'
ANSI C compilers) and a "make" program.</p>

<p>Mini-XML provides the following functionality:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Reading and writing of UTF-8 encoded XML files.</li>
	<li>Data is stored in a linked-list tree structure,
	preserving the XML data hierarchy.</li>
	<li>Supports arbitrary element names, attributes, and
	attribute values with no preset limits, just available
	memory.</li>
	<li>Supports integer, real, opaque ("cdata"), and text
	data types in "leaf" nodes.</li>
	<li>Functions for creating and managing trees of data.</li>
	<li>"Find" and "walk" functions for easily locating and
	navigating trees of data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mini-XML doesn't do validation or other types of processing
on the data based upon schema files or other sources of
definition information, nor does it support character entities
other than those required by the XML specification. Also, since
Mini-XML does not support the UTF-16 encoding, it is technically
not a conforming XML consumer/client.</p>

<h2>Building Mini-XML</h2>

<p>Mini-XML comes with an autoconf-based configure script; just
type the following command to get things going:</p>

<pre>
    ./configure
</pre>

<p>The default install prefix is /usr/local, which can be
overridden using the --prefix option:</p>

<pre>
    ./configure --prefix=/foo
</pre>

<p>Once you have configured the software, type "make" to do the
build and then run the test program to verify that things are
working, as follows:</p>

<pre>
    make
    ./testmxml test.xml
</pre>

<h2>Installing Mini-XML</h2>

<p>The "install" target will install Mini-XML in the lib and
include directories:</p>

<pre>
    make install
</pre>

<p>Once you have installed it, use the "-lmxml" option to link
your application against it.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>The documentation is currently just in this page.  At some
point I'll probably do some proper documentation, but for now
just read here and look at the <tt><a
href="testmxml.c">testmxml.c</a></tt> source file for an
example of reading and printing the contents of an XML file to
stdout.</p>

<p>Mini-XML provides a single header file which you include:</p>

<pre>
    <a href="mxml.h">#include &lt;mxml.h></a>
</pre>

<p>Nodes are defined by the <tt>mxml_node_t</tt> structure; the
<tt>type</tt> member defines the node type (element, integer,
opaque, real, or text) which determines which value you want to
look at in the <tt>value</tt> union.  New nodes can be created
using the <tt>mxmlNewElement()</tt>, <tt>mxmlNewInteger()</tt>,
<tt>mxmlNewOpaque()</tt>, <tt>mxmlNewReal()</tt>, and
<tt>mxmlNewText()</tt> functions. Only elements can have child
nodes, and the top node must be an element, usually "?xml".</p>

<p>You load an XML file using the <tt>mxmlLoadFile()</tt> function:</p>

<pre>
    FILE *fp;
    mxml_node_t *tree;

    fp = fopen("filename.xml", "r");
    tree = mxmlLoadFile(NULL, fp, MXML_NO_CALLBACK);
    fclose(fp);
</pre>

<p>Similarly, you save an XML file using the <tt>mxmlSaveFile()</tt>
function:</p>

<pre>
    FILE *fp;
    mxml_node_t *tree;

    fp = fopen("filename.xml", "w");
    mxmlSaveFile(tree, fp, MXML_NO_CALLBACK);
    fclose(fp);
</pre>

<p>You can find a named element/node using the
<tt>mxmlFindElement()</tt> function:</p>

<pre>
    mxml_node_t *node = mxmlFindElement(tree, tree, "name", "attr",
                                        "value", MXML_DESCEND);
</pre>

<p>The <tt>name</tt>, <tt>attr</tt>, and <tt>value</tt>
arguments can be passed as <tt>NULL</tt> to act as wildcards,
e.g.:</p>

<pre>
    /* Find the first "a" element */
    node = mxmlFindElement(tree, tree, "a", NULL, NULL, MXML_DESCEND);

    /* Find the first "a" element with "href" attribute */
    node = mxmlFindElement(tree, tree, "a", "href", NULL, MXML_DESCEND);

    /* Find the first "a" element with "href" to a URL */
    node = mxmlFindElement(tree, tree, "a", "href",
                           "http://www.easysw.com/~mike/mxml/", MXML_DESCEND);

    /* Find the first element with a "src" attribute*/
    node = mxmlFindElement(tree, tree, NULL, "src", NULL, MXML_DESCEND);

    /* Find the first element with a "src" = "foo.jpg" */
    node = mxmlFindElement(tree, tree, NULL, "src", "foo.jpg", MXML_DESCEND);
</pre>

<p>You can also iterate with the same function:</p>

<pre>
    mxml_node_t *node;

    for (node = mxmlFindElement(tree, tree, "name", NULL, NULL, MXML_DESCEND);
	 node != NULL;
	 node = mxmlFindElement(node, tree, "name", NULL, NULL, MXML_DESCEND))
    {
      ... do something ...
    }
</pre>

<p>Finally, once you are done with the XML data, use the
<tt>mxmlDelete()</tt> function to recursively free the memory
that is used for a particular node or the entire tree:</p>

<pre>
    mxmlDelete(tree);
</pre>
