The first release candidate for Mini-XML 2.0 is now available.

Mini-XML 2.0 adds a new programmers manual, support for reading
UTF-16 encoded files and strings (all output is still encoded
using UTF-8), a new indexing API to support fast searches of
large XML databases, new character entity and whitespace
callbacks, and several improvements and bug fixes for the
mxmldoc utility. The new release also fixes some makefile
problems.
