Mini-XML 1.3 adds support for all of the standard HTML entity
names, entities in element names, attribute names, and attribute
values, null attribute values,  and a new error callback for
catching errors instead of displaying them to stderr. The new
release also fixes some bugs with handling of poorly formed XML
data and in the mxmldoc utility.
